        <h2> Makers </h2>
        <p> After much deliberation over where to go and what to do with myself after losing my job, a couple of friends, who happened to be former alumni, told me to go for Makers. This is a decision I haven't for a second regretted. Whilst at times I've wondered
          whether I was doing the right thing, the support of those friends, those I met in the November 2020 cohort, and the coaches, has made me realise this is what I love to do.
