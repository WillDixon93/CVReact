        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p> A bar manager, a policy executive and a Student of Makers. The start to both a terrible 'walk into a bar' joke I haven't written a punchline for yet, and my career to date. 
          My first job post higher-education involved supplying budget submissions and recommendations to the Government, 
          writing toolkits to instruct businesses on how they can help alleviate the problem of homelessness and fixing IT for everyone else in the office.
          Through all of that I have found nothing that excites me more than writing code and a new, well-formatted and good-looking feature appears on a website page </p>

        <p> Please click the links above to find out more about me. </p>
      </div>
