        <h3> Revo (March 2019 - August 2020)</h3>
        <h3> Policy and Campaign Executive </h3> 
        <p> A first foray into the world of work that had very little to do with programming. 
          The role included campaign management, submissions to parliament and correspondence with Members of Parliament. 
          Previous campaigns that I was involved in included a "dragons den" style competition for start-up and small businesses to award space in a 
          number of shopping centres throughout the UK, and Revo's homelessness campaign that I lead on. 
          This involved submissions and recommendations to Parliament, the writing of functional toolkits for land and shopping centre owners to use in order to proactively 
          and compassionately help reduce homelessness in the UK.</p>
